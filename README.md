# .github

This is a special GitHub repository.

It contains normally e.g. workflow templates for this GitHub organization.

But we (METRO.digital) don't want to maintain replicas of workflow templates
in +25 different GitHub organizations.

Please see [here](https://github.com/metro-digital-inner-source/.github/tree/master/workflow-templates)
for M.d maintained workflow templates.
